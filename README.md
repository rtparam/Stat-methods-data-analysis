Final Project for Statistical Methods of Data analysis course (WT2022) in particle physics data analysis. 
The $q^2$ spectrum of $B \rightarrow D* l \nu$ decays 
Analysis of a Belle-II reconstructed sample of simulated $B^0 \rightarrow D^{*-} l^+  \nu$ decays produced from $e^+ e^- \rightarrow \Upsilon (4S) \rightarrow B^0 \bar{B^0}$ events to measure the $q^2$ spectrum used to calculate the CKM matrix. 
Involves reconstruction and performing binned maximum likelihood fits to discriminate signals and background from the data, testing goodness of fits for signal, performing $q^2$ fits and obtaining $q^2$ spectrum which is then unfolded for detector resolution effects.
